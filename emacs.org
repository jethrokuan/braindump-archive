* Why Emacs?
** Flexibility
Emacs Lisp makes it a joy to extend, attracting a large community of
lisp hackers. Case in point: Amazon's Customer Service application
Mailman was built in Emacs Lisp.

** Uniform Interface
Everything is text, everything is in a buffer. Keyboard movements work
everywhere, no surprises.

** Emacs has everything you need
- Web Browser (eww)
- IRC Client (erc/irc)
- Email Client (mu4e/notmuch/gnus)
- Emacs X Window Manager (exwm)
- File Browser (dired)
- doctor?

* Undo
There is no redo. Add a non-editing command to undo the undo, eg.
`C-g`. In that way `C-g C-_` performs a redo.

* Deleting Windows ^M (CR) characters
Simply run =M-x delete-trailing-whitespaces=
* Swiper
To enter thing-at-point into the mini-buffer, use ~M-n~. This calls
~ivy-next-history-element~.
* Org-mode
