<p>
Finite automata are a useful model for many kinds of important
software and hardware. Automatas are found in compilers, software for
designing digital circuits, and many more systems.
</p>

<p>
<i>Grammars</i> provide useful models when designing software that processes
data with a recursive structure. The compiler's parser deals with
recursively nested features. Regular Expressions also denote the
structure of data, especially in text strings.
</p>

<p>
The study of automata addresses the following questions:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What can a computer do?</li>
<li>What can a computer do efficiently?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Automata theory also provides a tool for making formal proofs, of both
the inductive and deductive type.

<p>
We can sometimes prove statements by construction. This is often the
case with recursively defined structures, such as with trees and
expressions. This works because we the recursive definition is invoked
at each step, so we are guaranteed that at each step of the
construction, the construction \(X_i\) is valid.

<p>
An automata has:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a set of states</li>
<li>its "control" moves from state to state in response to external inputs</li>
</ul>

<p>
A finite automata is one where the automaton can only be in a single
state at once (it is deterministic). Non-determinism allows us to
program solutions to problems using a higher-level language.
</p>

<p>
Determinism refers to the fact that on each input there is one and
only one state to which the automaton can transition from its current
state. Deterministic Finite Automata is often abbrieviated with <i>DFA</i>.

A <i>dfa</i> consists of:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A finite set of <i>states</i>, often denoted \(Q\).</li>
<li>A finite set of <i>input symbols</i>, often denoted \(\Sigma\).</li>
<li>A <i>transition function</i> that takes as arguments a state and an input
symbol and returns a state, often denoted \(\delta\). If \(q\) is a state,
and \(a\) is an input symbol, then \(\delta(q,a)\) is that state \(p\) such
that there is an arc labeled \(a\) from \(q\) to \(p\).</li>
<li>A <i>start state</i>, one of the states in \(Q\).</li>
<li>A set of <i>final</i> or <i>accepting</i> states \(F\). The set \(F\) is a subset of
\(Q\).</li>

\begin{equation}
  A = \left(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F \right)

A NFA has can be in several states at once, and this ability is
expressed as an ability to "guess" something about its input. It can

&epsilon;-closure allows us to explain easily what the transitions of an

that \(E = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\) is an &epsilon;-NFA. We first define \(\hat{\delta}\),

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-2-1">
<p>
We can number the finite states in a DFA \(A\) with \(1, 2, \dots, n\).
</p>

<p>
Let \(R_{ij}^{(k)}\) be the name of a regular expression whose language is the
set of strings \(w\) such that \(w\) is the label of a path from state \(i\)
to state \(j\) in a DFA \(A\), and the path has no intermediate node whose
number is greater than \(k\).
To construct the expression \(R_{ij}^{(k)}\), we use the following inductive
definition, starting at \(k= 0\), and finally reaching \(k=n\).
</p>

<p>
BASIS: \(k=0\).
Since the states are numbered \(1\) or above, the restriction on paths
is that the paths have no intermediate states at all. There are only 2
kinds of paths that meet such a condition:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An arc from node (state) \(i\) to node \(j\).</li>
<li>A path of length \(0\) that consists only of some node \(i\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
If \(i \ne j\), then only case \(1\) is possible. We must examine DFA \(A\)
and find input symbols \(a\) such that there is a transition from state
\(i\) to state \(j\) on symbol \(a\).
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If there is no such symbol \(a\), then \(R_{ij}^{(0)} = \emptyset\).</li>
<li>If there is exactly one such symbol \(a\), then \(R_{ij}^{(0)} = \mathbb{a}\)</li>
<li>If there are symbols \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k\) that label arcs from
state \(i\) to state \(j\), then \(R_{ij}^{(0)} = \mathbb{a_1} + \mathbb{a_2} +
   \dots + \mathbb{a_k}\)</li>
</ol>

<p>
In case (a), the expression becomes \(\epsilon\), in case (c), the expression
becomes \(\epsilon + \mathbb{a_1} + \mathbb{a_2} + \dots + \mathbb{a_k}\).
</p>

<p>
INDUCTION: Suppose there is a path from state \(i\) to state \(j\) that
goes through no state higher than \(k\). Then either:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The path does not go through state \(k\) at all. In this case, the
label of the path is \(R_{ij}^{(k-1)}\).</li>
<li>The path goes through state \(k\) at least once. We can break the
path into several pieces:</li>
</ol>

</p>
</div>

<p>
Then the set of labels for all paths of this type is represented by
the regular expression \(R_{ik}^{(k-1)}(R_{kk}^{(k-1)})^*R_{kj}^{(k-1)}\). Then, we can
combine the expressions for the paths of the two above:
</p>

\begin{equation}
R_{ij}^{(k)} = R_{ij}^{(k-1)} + R_{ik}^{(k-1)}(R_{kk}^{(k-1)})^*R_{kj}^{(k-1)}
\end{equation}

<p>
We can compute \(R_{ij}^{(n)}\) for all \(i\) and \(j\), and the language of the
automaton is then the sum of all expressions \(R_{ij}^{(n)}\) such that state
\(j\) is an accepting state.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-2-2">
<p>
The above method of conversation always works, but is expensive. \(n^3\)
expressions have to be constructed for an n-state automaton, but the
length of the expression can grow by a factor of 4 on the average,
with each of the \(n\) inductive steps, and the expressions themselves
could reach on the order of \(4^n\) symbols.
</p>

<p>
The approach introduced here avoids duplicating work at some points,
by eliminating states. If we eliminate a state \(s\), then all paths
that went through \(s\) no longer exist in the automaton. To preserve
the language, we must include on an arc that goes directly from \(q\) to
\(p\), the labels of paths that went from some state \(q\) to \(p\) through
\(s\). This label now includes strings, but we can use a regular
expression to represent all such strings.
</p>

<p>
Hence, we can construct a regular expression from a finite automaton
as follows:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For each accepting state \(q\), apply the reduction process to
produce an equivalent automaton with regular-expression labels on
the arcs. Eliminate all states except \(q\) and the start state \(q_0\).</li>

regular expression for the automaton is \((R + SU^*T)^*SU^*\).</li>

The proof is conducted by structural induction on R, following the
recursive definition of regular expressions.

The inductive step consists of 4 cases: (a) The expression is \(R + S\)
for some smaller expressions \(R\) and \(S\). (b) The expression is \(RS\)
for smaller expressions \(R\) and \(S\). (c) The expression is \(R*\) for

We have established that the class of languages known as regular
languages are accepted by DFAs, NFAs and by $&epsilon;$-NFAs.
</p>

<p>
However, not every language is a regular language. An easy way to see
this is that the number of languages is infinite, but DFAs have finite
number of states, and are finite.
</p>

<p>
The pumping lemma lets us show that certain languages are not regular.
</p>

<div class="theorem">
<p>
<a id="org6e30dc9"></a>
Let \(L\) be a regular language. Then there exists a constant \(n\) (which
depends on \(L\)) such that for every string \(w\) in \(L\) such that
\(| w |  \ge n\), we can break \(w\) into three strings \(w = xyz\)
such that:

That is, we can always find a non-empty string \(y\) not too far from
the beginning of \(w\) that can be "pumped". This means repeating \(y\)
any number of times, or deleting it, keeps the resulting string in the
language \(L\).

Context-free grammars are recursive definitions. For example, the

</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is a finite set of symbols that form the strings of the
language. These alphabets are called the <i>terminals</i>, or <i>terminal
symbols</i>.</li>
<li>There is a finite set of variables, or <i>nonterminals</i> or <i>syntactic

Every regular language can be generated by some right-linear grammar.
Suppose \(L\) is accepted by DFA \(A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\), Then, let \(G =
(Q, \Sigma, P, q_0)\) where,
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For \(q, p \in Q\), \(a \in \Sigma\), if \(\delta(q, a) = p\), then we have a
production in \(P\) of the form \(q \rightarrow ap\).</li>
<li>We also have productions \(q \rightarrow \epsilon\) for each \(q \in F\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
We can prove by induction on \(|w|\) that \(\hat{\delta}(q_0, w) = p\)  iff \(q_0
\Rightarrow^* wp\). This would give \(\hat{\delta}(q_0, w) \in F\)  iff \(q_0 \Rightarrow^* w\).

Chomsky normal form is useful in giving algorithms for working with

<p>
It is in essence a nondeterministic finite automaton with
&epsilon;-transitions permitted, with one additional capability: a stack on
which it can store a string of "stack symbols".
</p>

<p>
We can view the pushdown automaton informally as the device suggested
below:
</p>


<div class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<p>
A "finite-state-control" reads inputs, one symbol at a time. The
automaton is allowed to observe the symbol at the top of the stack,
and to base its transition on its current state. It :
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Consumes from the input the symbol it uses in the transition. If &epsilon;
is used for the input, then no input symbol is consumed.</li>
<li>Goes to a new state</li>
<li>Replaces the symbol at the top of the stack by any string. This
corresponds to &epsilon;, which corresponds to a pop of the stack. It could
also replace the top symbol by one other symbol. Finally the top
stack symbol could be replaced by 2 or more symbols, which has the
effect of changing the top stack symbol, and pushing one or more
new symbols onto the stack.</li>

<p>
We can specify a PDA \(P\) as follows:
</p>

\begin{equation}
  P = (Q,\Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, Z_0, F)
\end{equation}

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(Q\) is the finite set of states</li>
<li>\(\Sigma\) is the finite set of input symbols</li>
<li>\(\Gamma\) is the finite stack alphabet</li>
<li>\(\delta\) is the transition function, taking a triple $&delta;(q,a,X), where:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(q\) is a state in \(Q\)</li>
<li>\(a\) is either an input symbol in \(\Sigma\) or \(\epsilon\).</li>

<li>\(q_0\) the start state</li>
<li>\(Z_0\) the start symbol. Initially, the PDA's stack consists of this
symbol, nothing else</li>
<li>\(F\) is the set of accepting states</li>

<p>
The formal definition of a PDA contains no explicit mechanism to allow
the PDA to test for an empty stack. The PDA is able to get the same
effect by initially placing a special symbol $ on the stack. If it
sees the $ again, it knows that the stack effectively is empty.

We can also draw transition diagrams for PDAs. An example is shown
below.

For finite automata, the \(\hat{\gamma}\) notation was sufficient to
represent sequences of instantaneous descriptions through which a
finite automaton moved. However, for PDAs we need a notation that
describes changes in the state, input and stack. Hence, we define
\(\vdash\) as follows. Supposed \(\delta(q, a, X)\) contains \((p, \alpha)\). Then for
all stings \(w\) in \(\Sigma^*\) and \(\beta\) in \(\Gamma^*\):

<p>
If \(L = N(P_N)\) for some PDA \(P_N\), then there is a PDA \(P_F\)
such that \(L = L(P_F)\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof</b>:
</p>

<p>
We use a new symbol \(X_0\), not a symbol of \(\Gamma\); \(X_0\) is both the start
symbol of \(P_F\) and a marker on the bottom of the stack that lets us
know when \(P_N\) has reached an empty stack, then it knows that \(P_N\)
would empty its stack on the same input.
</p>

<p>
We also use a new start state \(p_0\), whose sole function is to push
\(Z_0\), the start symbol of \(P_N\), onto the top of the stack and enter
\(q_0\), the start state of \(P_N\). \(P_F\) simulates \(P_N\), until the stack of
\(P_N\) is empty, which \(P_F\) detects because it sees \(X_0\) on the top of
the stack.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-5">
<p>
Let \(A\) be a CFL. From the definition we know that \(A\) has a CFG, \(G\),
generating it. We show how to convert \(G\) into an equivalent PDA.
</p>

<p>
The PDA \(P\) we now describe will work by accepting its input \(w\), if
\(G\) generates that input, by determining whether there is a derivation
for \(w\). Each step of the derivation yields an intermediate string of
variables and terminals. We design \(P\) to determine whether some
series of substitutions of \(G\) can lead from the start variable to
\(w\).
</p>

<p>
The PDA \(P\) begins by writing the start variable on its stack. It goes
through a series of intermediate strings, making one substitution
after another. Eventually it may arrive at a string that contains only
terminal symbols, meaning that it has used the grammar to derive a
string. Then \(P\) accepts if this string is identical to the string it
has received as input.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Place the marker symbol $ and the start variable on the stack</li>
<li>Repeat:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the top of stack is a variable symbol \(A\), nondeterministically
select one of the rules for \(A\) and substitute \(A\) by the string
on the right-hand side of the rule</li>
<li>If the top of stack is a terminal symbol \(a\), read the next
symbol from the input and compare it to \(a\). If they match,
continue. Else, reject the branch of nondeterminism.</li>
<li>If the top of stack is the symbol $, enter the accept state.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
Now we prove the reverse direction. We have a PDA \(P\) and want to make
a CFG \(G\) that generates all the strings that \(P\) accepts.
</p>

<p>
For each pair of states \(p\) and \(q\), the grammar will have a variable
\(A_{pq}\).
</p>

<p>
First, we simplify the task by modifying P slightly to give it the
following three features.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It has a single accept state, \(q_{accept}\).</li>
<li>It empties its stack before accepting.</li>
<li>Each transition either pushes a symbol onto the stack (a push move)
or pops one off the stack (a pop move), but it does not do both at
the same time.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Giving \(P\) features 1 and 2 is easy. To give it feature 3, we replace
each transition that simultaneously pops and pushes with a two
transition sequence that goes through a new state, and we replace each
transition that simultaneously pops and pushes with a two transition
sequence that goes through a new state, and we replace each transition
that neither pops nor pushes with a two transition sequence that
pushes then pops an arbitrary stack symbol.
</p>


<p>
To design \(G\) so that \(A_{pq}\) generates all strings that take \(P\) from
\(p\) to \(q\), regardless of the stack contents at \(p\), leaving the stack
at \(q\) in the same condition as it was at \(p\).

First, we simplify our task by modifying \(P\) slightly to give it the
following three features.

First, we introduce the notion of substitutions. Let \(\Sigma\) be an
alphabet, and suppose that for every symbol \(a\) in \(\Sigma\), we choose a
language \(L_a\). These chosen languages can be over any alphabets, not
necessarily \(\Sigma\) and not necessarily the same. The choice of languages
defines a function \(s\) on \(\Sigma\), and we shall refer to \(L_a\) as \(s(a)\)
for each symbol \(a\).
</p>

<p>
If \(w = a_1 a_2 \dots a_n\) in \(\Sigma^*\), then \(s(w)\) is the language of
all strings \(x_1 x_2 \dots x_n\) such that the string \(x_i\) is in the
language \(s(a_i)\). \(s(L)\) is the union of \(s(w)\) for all strings \(w\) in
\(L\).
</p>

<p>
The substitution theorem states that if we can find a substitution
function \(a\) on a CFL, then the resultant language \(s(a)\) is also a
CFL.
</p>

<p>
CFLs are closed under:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Union</li>
</ol>

<p>
\(L_1 \cup L_2\) is the language \(s(L)\), where \(L\) is the language \(\{1,
2\}\), and \(s(1) = L_1\) and \(s(2) = L_2\).
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Concatenation</li>
</ol>

<p>
\(L_1 L_2\) is the language \(s(L)\), \(L = {12}\), and \(s(1) = L_1\) and \(s(2)

</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Closure, and positive closure (asterisk and plus)</li>
</ol>

<p>
\(L\) is the language \({1}^*\), and \(s\) is the substitution \(s(1) = L_1\),
then \(L_1^* = s(L)\). Similarly, for positive closure, \(L = \{1\}^+\) and
\(L_1^+ = s(L)\).
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Homomorphism</li>
</ol>
<p>
\(s(a) = \{h(a)\}\), for all \(a\) in \(\Sigma\). Then \(h(L) = s(L)\).
</p>

<p>
These are the base closure properties. CFLs are also closed under
reversal. We can prove this by constructing a grammar for the reversed
CFL.
</p>

<p>
CFLs are not closed under intersection. However, CFLs are closed under
the operation of "intersection with a regular language". To prove
this, we use the PDA representation of CFLs, and FA representation of
regular languages. We can run the FA in parallel with the PDA.
</p>

<p>
CFLs are also closed under inverse homomorphism. The proof is similar
to that of regular languages, but using a PDA, but is more complex
because of the stack introduced in the PDA.

First, we consider the complexity of converting from a CFG to a PDA,
and vice versa. Let \(n\) be the length of the entire representation of
a PDA or CFG.
</p>

<p>
Below, we list algorithms linear in the size of the input:

<li>Converting a PDA that accepts by final state to one that accepts by
empty stack</li>
<li>Converting a PDA that accepts by empty stack to one that accepts by

</ul>

<p>
The running time of conversion from a PDA to a grammar is much more
complex. The upper bound on the number of states and stack symbols is
\(n^3\), so there cannot be more than \(n^3\) variables of the form \([pXq\)
constructed for the grammar. However, the running time of conversion
could still be exponential because there are no limits to the number
of symbols put on the stack.
</p>

<p>
However, we can break the pushing of a long string of stack symbols
into a sequence of at most \(n\) steps that each pushes one symbol. Then
each transition has no more than 2 stack symbols, and the total length
of all the transition rules has grown by at most a constant factor,
i.e. it is still \(O(n)\). There are \(O(n)\) transition rules, and each
generates \(O(n^2)\) productions, since there are only 2 states that need
to be chosen in the productions that come from each rule. Hence, the
constructed grammar has length \(O(n^3)\), and can be constructed in
cubic time.

<p>
However eliminating $&epsilon;$-productions is tricky. If we have a production
body of length \(k\), we can construct from that one production \(2^{k-1}\)
productions for the new grammar, so this part of the construction
could take \(O(2^n)\) time. However, we can break all long production
bodies into a sequence of productions with bodies of length 2. This
step takes \(O(n)\) time and grows only linearly, and makes eliminating
$&epsilon;$-productions run in \(O(n)\) time.

<p>
In all, converting to CNF form is a \(O(n^2)\) algorithm.

This is equivalent to testing if \(S\) is generating. The algorithm goes
as follows:
</p>

<p>
We maintain an array indexed by variable, which tells whether or not
we have established that a variable is generating.For each variable
there is a chain of all the positions in which the variable occurs
(solid lines). The dashed lines suggest links from the productions to
their counts.

<p>
For each production, we count the number of positions holding
variables whose ability to generate is not yet accounted for. Each
time the count for a head variable reaches 0, we put the variable on a
queue of generating variables whose consequences need to be explored.

First, we can easily see that algorithms exponential in \(n\) can
decide membership. We can convert the grammar to CNF form. As the
parse trees are binary trees, there will be exactly \(2n-1\) nodes
labeled by variables in the tree for a string \(w\) of length \(n\). The
number of possible trees and node-labelings is only exponential in
\(n\).
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, more efficient techniques exist, based on the idea of
dynamic programming. Once such algorithm is the CYK Algorithm.
</p>

<p>
We construct a triangular table, and begin the fill the table
row-by-row upwards. The horizontal axis corresponds to the positions
of the string \(w = a_1 a_2 \dots a_n\), and the table entry \(X_ij\) is the
set of variables $A such that \(A \overset{*}{\Rightarrow} a_i a_{i+1} \dots a_j\). We
are interested in whether \(S\) is in the set \(X_{1n}\).
</p>



<div class="figure">
<p><img src="Properties of Context-Free Languages/screenshot_2018-10-12_17-37-31.png" alt="screenshot_2018-10-12_17-37-31.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
It takes \(O(n)\) time to compute any one entry of the table. Hence, the
table-construction process takes \(O(n^3)\) time.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm for computing \(X_{ij}\) is as such:
</p>

<p>
<b>BASIS</b>: We compute the first row as follows. Since the string beginning
 and ending at position \(i\) is just the terminal \(a_i\), and the grammar
 is in \(CNF\),the only way to derive the string \(a_i\) is to use a
 production of the form \(A \rightarrow a_i\). Hence \(X_ii\) is the set of variables
 \(A\) such that \(A \rightarrow a_i\) is a production of \(G\).
</p>

<p>
<b>INDUCTION</b>: To compute \(X_{ij}\) that is in row \(j - i + 1\), we would have
 computed all the \(X\) in the rows below i.e. we know about all strings
 shorter than \(a_i a_{i+1} \dots a_j\), and we know all the proper prefix
 and proper suffixes of that string.
</p>

<p>
For \(A\) to be in \(X_{ij}\), we must find variables \(B\), \(C\), and integer
\(k\) such that:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(i \le k < j\)</li>
<li>\(B\) is in \(X_{ik}\)</li>
<li>\(C\) is in \(I_{k+1,j}\)</li>
<li>\(A \rightarrow BC\) is a production of \(G\)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Finding such variables \(A\) requires us to compare at most \(n\) pairs of
previously computed sets. Hence it can be done in \(O(n)\) time.
